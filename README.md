# Tailwind CSS Hover Directive Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to Tailwind CSS hover directives. The issue arises when using hover states within a parent element that already has a background color defined.  The hover state might not work as expected in some cases. The bug is due to incorrect or unintended CSS specificity and cascading rules which can override the expected hover styles. This repository provides example code demonstrating the issue and the solution.

## Bug Description

The hover state on the button may not apply correctly and the button's background color may not change on hover.

## Solution

The solution involves understanding the specificity of CSS selectors and making sure the hover styles have a higher specificity than the parent styles. This can be achieved by using more specific selectors or by using the `!important` flag. The `!important` flag, while generally discouraged, can be used cautiously in specific situations to resolve this issue. However, consider refactoring your styles to avoid unnecessary use of `!important`.
